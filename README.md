# Async-Socket-TCP

I wanted to program a server which can handle alot of clients at the same time just like [MMORPG](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_Multiplayer_Online_Role-Playing_Game)-Servers do.

Many Languages are capable of doing this, but most of them are optimized for Web-Servers.  
Another important aspect is the amount of data being sent over the stream. There shouldn't be any limit for the package size.

## Code

Enough talking. Here are the complete codeblocks for each client- and serverside.  
I implemented a little bit more code than above in the tutorial, but everything should be well explained in the comments.  
Feel free to use this code and maybe program your own little MMORPG software.
